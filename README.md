streams.py - Module for generating streamfiles

fourier_diffraction.py - Module for modeling diffraction in the far field regime with hologram gratings represented by numpy arrays

grating_generation.py - Module for generating numpy arrays which represent hologram gratings

diffractionEfficiencyCalculator.py - Code using fourier_diffraction.py and grating_generation.py to calculate the diffraction efficiency for a binary, or blazed grating (can easily add other kinds of gratings by modifying the inital code block)
